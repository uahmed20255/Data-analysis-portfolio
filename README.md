# Project 1: Marathon Data Analysis
Explored a marathon dataset from Kaggle to understand athlete statistics and race outcomes. Cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to answer key questions about the marathon. Used Python and Google Colab for seamless cloud-based development.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing or inconsistent data. Extracted relevant features such as race distance, athlete gender, and performance metrics.

# Analysis & Insights:
- Identified correlations between age, gender, and performance.
- Grouped and analyzed race data by distance categories (e.g., 5K, 10K, marathon).
- Visualization:
- Created insightful visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to display key trends.

# Project 3: 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python

This project uses Python and data analysis tools to explore and visualize COVID-19 trends worldwide. It leverages pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean, process, and display data from the pandemic.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook analyzes COVID-19 data by:

- Loading and cleaning real-world COVID-19 datasets
- Calculating total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
- Analyzing case trends by country
- Creating visualizations (line plots, bar graphs, etc.)
- Identifying insights and patterns in the data

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Visualizations

Key visualizations include:

- Line graphs showing the spread of COVID-19 over time
- Bar charts comparing country-wise case and death totals
- Heatmaps to show case distribution
