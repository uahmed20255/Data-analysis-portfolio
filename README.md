# Marathon Project Overview
Explored a marathon dataset from Kaggle to understand athlete statistics and race outcomes.
Cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to answer key questions about the marathon.
Used Python and Google Colab for seamless cloud-based development.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing:
-Cleaned missing or inconsistent data.
- Extracted relevant features such as race distance, athlete gender, and performance metrics.

# Analysis & Insights:
- Identified correlations between age, gender, and performance.
- Grouped and analyzed race data by distance categories (e.g., 5K, 10K, marathon).
- Visualization:
- Created insightful visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots to display key trends.

# Learning Objectives:
- Reinforced concepts like data grouping, aggregation, and conditional logic in Python.
- Explored the use of external datasets for practical problem-solving.

# Getting Started
